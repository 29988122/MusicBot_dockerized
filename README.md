# MusicBot_dockerized
Since https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot/issues/954 https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot/issues/1883 jaydenkieran and Musicbot abandon the support of docker, I decided to build one.

1. Remember to popup your own option.ini and permission.ini in /config
2. Work under /MusicBot_dockerized
3. sudo docker build -f ./docker/dockerfile -t musicbot_dockerized:latest .
4. Done. Run it via the commands mentioned in /docker/RUN COMMAND
